# wpNewsTheme

WordPress theme built from scratch for news websites and blogs.

In the folder "wpNewsTheme_html" there is the static HTML website which was made first and then it was transformed into WordPress theme (in the folder "wpNewsTheme_wordpress").

The front-page is divided into the sections:
1. Header area:
- Menus 
- Logo
- Banner area (728x90) which can be managed from the widgets area
2. Main area:
- Header Grid which displays the top news from all the categories (by selecting the Header Grid category when publishing new post)
- Featured which displays important news from all the categories (by selecting the Featured category when publishing new post)
- Latest from categories - 4 articles excerpts from each of the categories (News, Bussines, Opinion, Sport and Showbizz)
3. Sidebar which displays banners but it can be managed from the widget area, so it can have much more
4. Footer which displays the author and copyright info

On the post page you can read the selected article, but you also will have the chance to see which are the top news from the Header Grid and the Featured areas (in the middle column, right of the article), even without visiting the front-page. Under the article there is an area called Similar news which displays the latest 4 articles from the same category.
